## Customization

### AI Integration
The current implementation uses mock AI responses for demonstration. To integrate with a real AI service:

1. **Replace the `mockImageAnalysis` function in `script.js`**
2. **Add your AI service API calls** (OpenAI Vision, Google Cloud Vision, etc.)
3. **Update the response format** to match your API's output

Example integration points:
```javascript
// In script.js, replace mockImageAnalysis function
async function mockImageAnalysis(imageFile) {
    // Your AI API integration here
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('image', imageFile);
    
    const response = await fetch('YOUR_AI_API_ENDPOINT', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
        }
    });
    
    return await response.json();
}
```

### Styling Customization
- Modify CSS custom properties in `:root` for color scheme changes
- Adjust responsive breakpoints in media queries
- Customize animation timing and effects

### Content Updates
- Update safety tips and emergency information
- Modify chatbot responses in `generateBotResponse` function
- Add new animal categories and safety guidelines
